## 1. Architecture Overview
{High-level architecture description}

### 1.1 System Verification Target
> **Every exit gate (2, 3 and 4)**: the harness executes `make verify-system`. A
> non-zero exit fails the gate. The target name is fixed — the harness always calls
> `make verify-system`.
>
> This is the only check in the whole framework that runs the delivered system.
> Everything else reads your source text or runs your test suite, both of which
> your test doubles configure. Two rules follow, and the gate enforces both:
>
> 1. **At least one step must invoke the delivered entry point** — the program a
>    user would run (`python -m <your_package> …`, your console script, your
>    service). A target that chains `test lint coverage` re-runs dimensions the
>    gate has already scored and verifies nothing further.
> 2. **The step that does so must be able to fail.** `|| true`, a leading `-`,
>    and tool flags like `ruff --exit-zero` all keep a failure out of make's exit
>    code, which is the only thing the gate reads.
>
> Aim for a step that exercises a real acceptance criterion against real
> dependencies — a temporary database, a real file, the actual process — because
> the gate also measures which of your high-risk modules this target executed.
> Any module your test suite replaces with an `autouse` stand-in has to run for
> real here.
**Makefile target**: `verify-system`
**Exercises**: {which high-risk modules / acceptance criteria this target executes}

## 2. Module Design

### 2.1 Directory Structure Design Principles

> **CRG Architecture Scoring**: Phase 3+ judges your code's community cohesion via
> the Code Review Graph (CRG).  CRG groups files by **directory** — each directory
> is one community.  The architecture score is the fraction of communities that are
> "healthy" (internal edge density ≥ 0.3 AND size ≤ 50 nodes).
>
> **CRG scoring formula**: Each community's cohesion = internal_edges / (internal_edges + external_edges).
> External edges = calls to libraries (stdlib, frameworks) + calls to other communities.
> Internal edge dilution is the primary risk — entry points (CLI, main.py) import many libraries,
> producing external edges with no offsetting internal edges unless they also call sibling modules.
> The fix is **not** to reduce library imports — it is to ensure every function body also calls at least one
> sibling within the same directory.
>
> **Required edge budget**: To reach cohesion ≥ 0.3 with E external edges, you need
> I ≥ ceil(0.4286 × E) internal edges. Each function-body call to a hub function = 1 internal edge.
> Module-level calls create 1 edge per file, but per-function-body calls multiply the count.
> Example: 48 external edges → need ≥21 internal edges. With 5 sibling files each having
> 4 function bodies calling 2 hub functions → 40 internal edges — safely above threshold.

**Design for high cohesion from the start — 6 Universal CRG Design Principles:**

**Principle 1 — Use subdirectories to control CRG community boundaries.** CRG assigns one community per directory. If you dump 10+ files into a flat `src/`, CRG's Leiden algorithm freely splits them into unpredictable communities — some will likely fall below the 0.3 cohesion threshold. Explicit subdirectories (`src/api/`, `src/core/`, `src/infrastructure/`) each become one predictable community. Aim for 3-6 source directories total (excluding tests). Fewer than 3 → oversized single community; more than 6 → too many communities to keep all above 0.3.

**Principle 2 — Every directory needs a hub module (≥2 functions for 4+ siblings).** Each directory with ≥2 files must have a shared module (`utils.py`, `common.py`, `helpers.py`) that ≥70% of sibling files import and call via standalone function calls: `result = hub.fn(...)`. This creates cross-file internal edges. Pure library-utility files that no sibling calls produce zero internal edges — they only dilute the community.

For directories with ≥4 sibling files, **one hub function is rarely enough** — a single function called from 5 files produces ~5 edges, which may not offset ~40+ external edges. Use **≥2 hub functions** so each sibling can call both from multiple function bodies, multiplying internal edge count. The tts-new infrastructure directory (5 siblings, 48 external edges) required 2 hub functions (`validate_config` + `get_config_snapshot`) called from every function body to reach ~32 internal edges and pass 0.3.

Exception: directories that form a linear processing pipeline (A→B→C) where each file calls the next in chain.

**Principle 3 — Entry points must live inside a hub directory.** Entry-point modules (CLI, `main.py`, `app.py`, daemon) unavoidably import many external libraries — httpx, FastAPI, argparse, asyncio, etc. Each external import adds an external edge. If the entry point sits alone at the project root (e.g. `src/cli.py`), those external edges dominate and cohesion drops below 0.3. Place entry points inside a directory that also contains a hub module — the entry point calls the hub (internal edges) to compensate for its external edges.

**Principle 4 — Every function body must call a hub function (not just module-level).** A file that is never imported or called by any other file in its directory contributes only external edges (its own imports) and zero internal edges — pure dilution. For each file in your design, verify it is either: (a) the hub module itself, (b) called by the hub, or (c) calls the hub. Files that fail this check should be merged into another file or directory.

Critically, **module-level calls alone are insufficient**. A module-level `_ = validate_config()` creates 1 internal edge per file regardless of how many functions it has. CRG counts edges per (caller_node, callee_node) pair — each function body that calls the hub creates a separate edge. To accumulate enough internal edges (see edge budget above), the hub function must be called **from every accessible function body** in each sibling file, not just at module level. Example: a 5-sibling directory needs ~21 internal edges; 5 module-level calls + 5×4 function-body calls = 25 edges.

**Principle 5 — Respect CRG edge-detection limits.** CRG uses Tree-sitter AST parsing and detects cross-file function calls resolved through imports. These limitations are cross-language:
- Calls between functions in the **same** file — NOT detected (zero cohesion contribution)
- `self.method()` calls inside a class — DETECTED (class hierarchy contributes edges)
- `import sibling` → `sibling.fn()` — DETECTED (cross-file import resolved)
- `result = hub.fn(...)` then `log.info(..., extra=result)` — DETECTED (standalone assignment)
- `log.info(..., extra=hub.fn(...))` — INCONSISTENTLY detected (nested arg position)
- Calls through imports at runtime (lazy imports in `__getattr__`, `__init__.py` re-exports) — may be missed if not statically resolvable

**Principle 6 — Size cap: communities stay under 50 nodes.** CRG marks any community with >50 nodes as unhealthy regardless of cohesion. A node ≈ one function or class in a file. If your directory design would produce >50 nodes (roughly 4-6 modules with 8-12 functions each), split into subdirectories. Unlike Principles 1-5, this can be relaxed slightly — the cap is 50, not 30 — so this is rarely the binding constraint unless you have large god-modules.

| Quick reference | check |
|----------------|-------|
| Source directories count? | 3-6 |
| Each dir has a hub file? | Yes |
| Hub has ≥2 functions if ≥4 sibling files? | Yes |
| Entry points inside a hub dir? | Yes |
| Each function body calls a hub function? | Yes (not just module-level) |
| Cross-file calls use standalone assignment? | Yes |
| Community size ≤ 50 nodes? | Yes |
| Edge budget: I ≥ 0.4286 × E? | Yes |

**Anti-patterns that produce low scores:**

```
❌ src/__init__.py, src/main.py, src/models.py, src/cli.py, src/audio.py
   → 5 isolated files in flat src/, zero cross-imports → cohesion=0.0

❌ src/cli.py  (imports httpx, argparse, asyncio — all external, no internal sibling calls)
   → pure external edges, no compensation → cohesion near 0

❌ tests/test_fr01.py, tests/test_fr02.py, ... tests/test_fr08.py
   → 80 nodes in one dir, no internal edges → oversized + zero cohesion

✅ src/api/{cli,main,speech,utils}.py with utils imported by all siblings → hub-and-spoke
✅ src/engines/{synthesis,splitter,parser}.py with synthesis calling both → pipeline chain
✅ src/infrastructure/{circuit,health,config,models}.py → shared domain layer

## 5. SAB Block (machine-readable — BINDING CONTRACT)

> **CONTRACT**: Field names, types, `sab:` root key, and `phase` as int must
> match `core/quality_gate/sab_parser.py:render_canonical_sab_template()`.

> EXAMPLE values with your project's real values.
> Validate before committing: `python3 scripts/generate_sab.py --validate --project .`

## 6. Security Design (STRIDE-lite — machine-readable, BINDING CONTRACT)

> **CONTRACT**: Field names and the `security_design:` root key are parsed
> by `core/quality_gate/security_design.py:extract_security_block()`.
> Do NOT hand-write the YAML — paste from the canonical template and
> replace EXAMPLE values with your project's real values.
> Validate: `python3 harness_cli.py check-artifact-consistency --project .`
>
> `applicability: none` is a fully valid, honest declaration for a project
> with no real attack surface (e.g. a pure CLI formatting tool) — it
> requires a `justification` (>=20 chars) and skips the rest of this
> block. This is a decidable structural check, not a keyword scorer: an
> honest `none` always passes.

<!-- SEC:START -->
```yaml
security_design:
  version: "1.0"
  applicability: full   # full | none — none REQUIRES justification and skips the rest
  justification: ""     # required (>=20 chars) when applicability: none
  trust_boundaries:     # EXAMPLE — replace with your project's real boundaries
    - id: TB-01
      name: "external HTTP input"
      description: "requests crossing from unauthenticated clients into the API layer"
  threats:              # STRIDE-lite — every boundary needs >=1 threat
    - id: T-01
      boundary: TB-01
      category: tampering   # spoofing|tampering|repudiation|information_disclosure|denial_of_service|elevation_of_privilege
      description: "malformed payload mutates task state without validation"
      mitigation: "schema validation + reject on unknown fields"
      owner_module: "app.api.webhooks"   # MUST be a module declared in the SAB block (§5)
      nfr: NFR-02                        # optional — MUST exist in SRS when present
      verified_by: "test_sec_t01_malformed_payload_rejected"   # single test name only — NOT "test_a, test_b"; split multi-test threats into separate T-NN entries
```
<!-- SEC:END -->

Note: `owner_module` must name a module declared in the §5 SAB block;
`nfr` (optional) must exist in SRS.md; `verified_by` names the test that
proves the mitigation — from Phase 5 onward, `check-artifact-consistency`
blocks if that test doesn't exist yet. Threats also seed
`bug-hunt-targets`' adversarial-review targeting and force NFR-pattern
test cases in `derive_test_cases.md` Step 1c regardless of SRS keywords.
